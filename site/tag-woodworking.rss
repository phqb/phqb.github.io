So I bought this jig</p>

<p>But my wood plank's end-grain is too small for this jig to be stable. I tried to hold the jig with my hand (It's dangerous, do not try this) but the drill bit is still jiggle.</p>
<p>Desperately, I used another straight wood plank as a reference to eyeball the drill bit along left-right axis.</p>

<p>For up-down axis, I eyeballed the drill bit along it once then tried to hold my drill straight.</p>
<p>The result is quite good</p>

<p>The dowel is slightly crooked along up-down axis. But it is usable.</p>

<p>I'll add a bubble level indicator to guide my drill straight along up-down axis.</p>
<p>I'm happy with this technique.</p>
